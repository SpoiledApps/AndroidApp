# AndroidApp
PLEASE READ THIS EVERYONE!

This new update includes the Firebase implementation meaning that the app is now connected to the Firebase project made which you will have access to just like how in a shared Google Docs sheet. Additionally, I made the login button work to take you to the home page however, I'm not sure if I'm the only one but let me know if you have the same issue so we can fix this. 

PLEASE USE THE UPDATED VERSION ONLY! DO NOT USE THE FIRST FOLDER. ONLY USE THE ZIP FILE.
